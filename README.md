I am an enthusiast of technology and how it can be implemented for good and useful purposes.

I have experience with React.js and Angular.js on the frontend creating SPAs that consume data from APIs and Firebase.

On the backend I usually use Node.js and frameworks like Express, Fastify and Nest.js creating APIs and microservices that connect to MongoDB, as well as implementations to CommerceTools API and Google Cloud Functions.

I have also done personal projects with Python, from small scripts to more advanced projects with Django, sqlite and Heroku.

I also like to develop videogames using Unity Engine and currently I have my own apps available in Google Play Store.

My hobbies (yes, I spend time away from the computer) are play soccer, running, read books, biking and play with my dog Rocko.
